Features:
1) Designed and implemented a secure user authentication mechanism for an E-healthcare mobile application
using Solidity and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring robust data protection and user privacy.
2) Developed a decentralized E-healthcare mobile application leveraging Dart and the Flutter framework,
enhancing user experience and accessibility for patients and healthcare providers.
3) Implemented a Social-IoT network integrating heart rate and ECG sensors using Arduino UNO and NodeMCU
firmware, enabling real-time health monitoring and data collection.
4) Secured access to real-time IoT sensor data transmitted to the mobile application via Firebase Cloud,
enabling healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patientsâ€™ vital signs.
